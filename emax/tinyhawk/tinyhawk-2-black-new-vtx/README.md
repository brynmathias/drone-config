# Tiny hawk 2, with a replacement board, has new VTX

New vtx has antena on the bottom and a chip pad on the top for distinugishability

Recieved file from EMAX with config, stored in this file (base_from_emax)

We put project mocking bird over the top, but need to edit the mocking bird config to take the new vtx settings as seen in the BF 4.2.11 diff
